# scrap-buscacep-data

This is a project to scrap CEP data from [buscacep website]([url](https://buscacepinter.correios.com.br/app/endereco/index.php?t/)) from Brazillian Correios.

## Importance

Multiple softwares rely on postal code data to make their services possible. However, the main source of updated CEP information for this is the Correios website, and unfortunately they don't make this information public as a free web API, or make the full data available for downloading. Whenever someone needs updated CEP data, be it for a personal database or a large software's, they end up relying on paid API's or outdated CEP dumps accross the internet.

Of course, this kind of data should be public and made available for free.

## What is CEP?

CEP (_Código de Endereço Postal_) is the Brazilian postal code system.

## What does this repository features?

This repository has nothing, yet.

## What will be implemented in the future?

- Web scraping scripts with Javascript and/or Python
- Captcha solving AI using computer vision to aid the automation.
    - This is needed because the Correios website has captcha to block multiple automated requests to the search.
